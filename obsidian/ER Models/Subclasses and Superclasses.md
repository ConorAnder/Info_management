Each [[Entity]] may have an additional meaningful subgrouping of entities or specialisations.

For example the [[Entity]] Employee may be subcategorised into:

* Engineer
* Technician
* Secretary

Every member that is a part of a subclass is also a member of every parent entity above it and as such, they inherit the attributes of each superclass in which they belong.

These subclass-superclass connections are denoted by lines to a circle which denote the [[Constraint]] and the subset symbol $\subset$ to denote the direction.

Each subclass can have [[Attribute]]s which belong only to the subclass itself and any further children of the class which are called specific or local [[Attribute]]s.
