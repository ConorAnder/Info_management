Strategy for creating an entity relation model.

1. Identify all of the [entities](Entity).
2. For each [[Entity]], identify the [[Attribute]]s and their types.
3. Draw individual mappings of each [[Entity]] and their [[Attribute]]s.
4. Identify the [[Relation]]s between [entities](Entity).
5. Decide on the [[Participation]] and [[Cardinality]] of the [[Relation]]s.
6. Assign any [[Attribute]]s associated with each [[Relation]].
7. Draw the ER model.
