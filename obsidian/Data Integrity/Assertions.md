An assertion is a database-wide rule enforcing a condition that must always hold true. They are used to enforce complex integrity rules that may involve multiple tables or aggregated values.

## Constraints vs Assertions

* Both [[Constraints]] and Assertions enforce data integrity.
* [[Constraints]] apply to a single table or row.
* Assertions can express global conditions across multiple tables.

Constraints define what data is valid locally,

Assertions define what the database must satisfy globally.
