SQL provides various mechanisms to ensure and maintain data integrity.

* **[[Constraints]]**: Rules attached directly to tables or columns that restrict the values data can take.
* **[[Assertions]]**: User-defined conditions that must always hold true for the database as a whole.
* **[[Triggers]]**: Procedures that automatically execute in response to specified events (such as insert, update, or delete) on a table.
