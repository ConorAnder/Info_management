The term ‘personal data’ means any information concerning or relating to a living person who is either identified or identifiable (i.e. the ‘data subject’).

Certain types of sensitive personal data are subject to additional protection under the
GDPR. The special categories are:

* Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin.
* Political opinions.
* Religious or philosophical beliefs.
* Trade union membership.
* Genetic data and biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person.
* Data concerning health.
* Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

## What is Data Processing?

The term “processing” refers to any operation or set of operations performed on personal data.

Processing includes
* storing,
* collecting,
* retrieving,
* using,
* combining,
* erasing and
* destroying personal data.

## Lawful Basis for Personal Data Processing

* [[Consent]]
	* The data subject has given explicit, informed, and unambiguous consent.
	* Example: User subscribes to a newsletter and checks a box to receive marketing emails.
	
* Performance of a Contract
	* Necessary for a contract to which the data subject is a party or for pre-contractual steps at their request.
	* Example: Customer provides an address to receive an online purchase.
	
* Legal Obligation
	* Necessary to comply with a legal requirement.
	* Example: Employer processes employee data to submit tax information.

* Vital Interests
	* Necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person.
	* Example: Hospital processes patient data in an emergency to provide life-saving treatment.
	
* Public Interest or Official Authority
	* Necessary for tasks in the public interest or under official authority.
	* Example: Government collects data during a census.
	
* Legitimate Interests
	* Necessary for the controller’s legitimate interests unless overridden by the subject’s rights.
	* Example: Company uses website analytics to improve functionality while respecting user privacy.


* Legal bases must be selected carefully and documented for compliance.
* Consent is a preferred basis only when no other legal basis applies.
* Each basis has specific conditions and should be evaluated in context.

## Data Breach

A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data.

Personal data breaches can be the result of both:
* Accidents
* Deliberate acts

There are two primary obligations on controllers under GDPR:
* notification of any personal data breach to the DPC.
* communication of that breach to data subjects.
