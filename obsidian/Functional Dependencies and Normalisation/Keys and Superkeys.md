In a [[Functional Dependency]], if we can use any number of [[Attribute]]s to uniquely identify the [[Entity]], this can be described as a superkey.

Superkeys that require the lowest number of attributes to describe an [[Entity]] are known as keys and can be said to be minimal.

Any minimal key can be called a candidate key, though only one can be chosen as the primary key.

A prime attribute is any [[Attribute]] that is a member of a candidate key.
